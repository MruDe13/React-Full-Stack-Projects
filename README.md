# React-Full-Stack-Projects

A collection of projects made during the Full Stack Web Development Course using React.

1. First Project is Monsters Rolodex. In this project, I learnt to use React Class component to divide and make independent components in our web app. The second step is to change the Class components into Functional components and make use of react hooks.
